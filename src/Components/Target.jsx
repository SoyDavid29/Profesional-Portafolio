        Hey there! I'm a Computer Systems Engineering student with a big passion for UX/UI Design. 
        I love turning ideas into stunning websites that are fun, functional, and leave a great first impression. 
        For me, design is all about blending creativity and user experience 
        to make people fall in love with a website one click at a time.
